    "I therefore took courses and joined coding clubs, amongst them a coding club run by students at the University of Oslo. I continued on consistently programming for years, and eventually took my skills into the business sector. I am genuinely motivated by solving problems, and creating solutions for businesses, and consumers.\n\nI have 4+ years of experience developing natively for Android. During that time, I worked with technologies such as Java, Firebase, REST-API's, general JSON, front and back-end XML. I also have 2+ years of experience within Flutter and Dart. My knowledge from developing natively translated well, and I quickly mastered the framework and language. Other notable technologies I am familiar with include: C#, Unity, Python, HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.\n\nI'm always interested in new and exciting opportunities, so feel free to contact me via the contact page, or check out my work!";
